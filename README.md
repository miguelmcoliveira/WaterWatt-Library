# WaterWatt-Library
A library containing components for the modelling of industrial water circuits (IWC), a specific type of water systems.

The ThermoPower Library (https://github.com/casella/ThermoPower) is a necessary dependance. The WaterWatt models cannot be loaded without having loaded the ThermoPower library first.

To simulate the IWC examples, be sure to run the simulation of the CircuitTable models (not the CircuitBase).
